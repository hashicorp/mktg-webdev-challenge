## Submitting Your Work

Please **do not submit a pull request to, or open any issues in this repo**. This is a template repository only. All your work should be done on your copy of the repo only. To begin your challenge:

- Create a new private repository using this one as a template. This can be done in two ways:
  - Clicking the "Use this template" button on the GitHub home page
  - Visiting the generate page: [mktg-webdev-challenge/generate](https://github.com/hashicorp/mktg-webdev-challenge/generate)
- In your new repository, go to Settings > Collaborators
- Add the following usernames as collaborators: `mwickett`, `dstaley`, `kaitlynnefuery` and `zchsh`

To submit your work, create a branch within your copy of the repo, and make a pull request against your copy of the repo's `main` branch. We encourage posting work-in-progress pull requests early on this team, but you are welcome to put up your PR whenever you feel comfortable. When you feel the work is complete and ready for review, let us know in the Discord channel and/or tag us as reviewers. You will be evaluated on the quality and attention to detail that you give the pull request in all aspects, so please take your time and be thorough before requesting a review.

We'll review your PR and leave comments and questions. You're not expected to write any additional code after review, but we'd love to see you reply to review questions to share your thinking.
