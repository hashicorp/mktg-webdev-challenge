## Submitting Your Work

Please **do not submit a pull request to, or open any issues in this repo**. This is a template repository only. To submit your challenge, hit the "use this template" button on github to create a copy of it for yourself and Grant access to `kylemac`, `mwickett`, and `brkalow` as collaborators. All your work should be done on your copy of the repo only.

To submit your work, create a branch within your copy of the repo, and make a pull request against your copy of the repo's `main` branch. We encourage posting work-in-progress pull requests early on this team, but you are welcome to put up your PR whenever you feel comfortable. When you feel the work is complete and ready for review, let us know in the slack channel and/or tag us as reviewers. You will be evaluated on the quality and attention to detail that you give the pull request in all aspects, so please take your time and be thorough before requesting a review.
